[FeatureSelectionBeforeSampling]: Feature selection is performed before SMOTE oversampling, which can lead to information loss. Features are selected based on the original imbalanced dataset, potentially discarding features that become important after oversampling.  
[DataLeakage]: The same scaler is fit on the resampled training data and then used to transform the test data. This introduces data leakage because the test data is indirectly influencing the scaling parameters.  
[HardcodedPath]: The path to the data file is constructed using os.path.join which relies on the existence and content of utils.get_project_root() which is not included in the code. The root can change based on the execution environment and can cause errors if it is not what is expected. This makes the code less portable.
