[Data leakage]: The entire dataset `raw_data` is used to fit the `ColumnTransformer` before splitting into training and testing sets. This leads to data leakage, where the test set influences the transformation parameters, resulting in an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance.
[Label binarization mismatch]: The `label_binarize` function is used to convert the target variable 'score_text' into binary labels. It's crucial to ensure that the classes parameter in `label_binarize` is consistent during training and testing. Inconsistencies may lead to shape mismatches during evaluation or training.
[Inconsistent target variable]: The code extracts the target variable `raw_data['score_text']` *before* the feature engineering. Since the feature engineering pipeline involves transformations like `OneHotEncoder` and `KBinsDiscretizer` on other features, the target variable should have been extracted *after* and aligned with the processed data. Otherwise, the alignment between features and target will be messed up.
[Missing data split before feature engineering]: Data cleaning and preprocessing, including imputation and encoding, should ideally be performed after splitting the data into training and testing sets to prevent data leakage. In this code, the pipeline is applied to the entire dataset before splitting, which can lead to overfitting and biased performance estimates.
[Incorrect target variable for splitting]: The target variable used for the train/test split `raw_data['score_text']` is not consistent with the data used for the split `data_without_labels`. It should use the binarized `train_labels` and `test_labels` instead.
[Misalignment of target variable with processed data]: The target variable 'score_text' is extracted *before* the data is processed using the ColumnTransformer. The processed data, `prepared_data`, is then split, but the corresponding labels `train_labels` and `test_labels` which should align with the processed `train_data` and `test_data` are extracted from `raw_data['score_text']`. This means the model is trained and evaluated on misaligned data.
