[Data Leakage]: Imputing missing 'Age' values using the mean of the entire dataset before splitting the data into training and testing sets leads to data leakage, as the test set's information influences the training set.
[Insufficient Data Exploration]: The code does not include any exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution, identify potential outliers, or discover relationships between features.
[Inadequate Feature Engineering]: The feature engineering is limited to one-hot encoding and simple mean imputation, neglecting potentially valuable transformations or combinations of features. For example, family size and title could be engineered.
[Lack of Cross-Validation]: The code does not implement cross-validation to assess the model's performance on different subsets of the training data, leading to a potentially biased evaluation based on a single train-test split.
[No Hyperparameter Tuning]: The RandomForestClassifier is used with default hyperparameters, without any attempt to optimize them using techniques like grid search or random search.
[Ignoring Feature Importance]: The code does not analyze or utilize feature importance scores to gain insights into which features are most predictive or to potentially reduce dimensionality.
[Potential Overfitting]: Training a RandomForestClassifier without proper regularization or hyperparameter tuning might lead to overfitting on the training data.
[Label Encoding Issues]: Label encoding 'Survived' might not be appropriate, especially if this was multiclass.
[No Model Persistence]: There is no code to save the trained model for later use, which is a standard practice in ML pipelines.
[Class Imbalance Handling]: There is no explicit handling of class imbalance, which might be present in the 'Survived' target variable, potentially affecting model performance.
[Unclear Metric Justification]: The choice of accuracy and classification report as evaluation metrics is not justified. Other metrics might be more relevant depending on the specific goals and characteristics of the problem.
[Missing Value Handling Alternatives]: Using only mean imputation may not be the best strategy. More advanced techniques like using the median, mode, or a model-based imputation should be considered.
[Outlier Handling]: The code doesn't handle outliers, which could disproportionately influence model training.
