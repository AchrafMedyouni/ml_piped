[Data Leakage]: Using LabelEncoder on the entire feature set 'X' before splitting into training and test sets leads to data leakage. The encoder learns the mapping from the entire dataset, which includes information from the test set, and this information is then used during training.  
[Multicollinearity]: The dataset is known to have high correlation between 'G1', 'G2', and 'G3'. Training a model without addressing multicollinearity can lead to unstable or unreliable coefficient estimates and reduce the model's ability to generalize to new data.  
[Class Imbalance]: The target variable 'G3' represents student grades, which might have a skewed distribution. If there's a significant class imbalance, the model might be biased towards the majority class. The code does not account for class imbalance.
[Regression as Classification]: The target variable, 'G3' which is a grade, is treated as a categorical variable. This implies that the grades are being treated as distinct classes rather than continuous values. It could be more appropriately treated as a regression problem.
