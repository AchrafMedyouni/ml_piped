[Data Filtering Bias]: Filtering the data based on 'Age' and 'HighChol' *before* splitting into training and test sets can introduce bias if these features are correlated with the target variable or other features, leading to a non-representative test set.  
[Data Leakage]: Performing feature selection or data preprocessing (like filtering) on the entire dataset before splitting can lead to data leakage, where information from the test set influences the training process, resulting in overly optimistic performance estimates.
[Potential Imbalance after Filtering]: Filtering based on 'Age' and 'HighChol' could disproportionately reduce the number of instances of certain classes in the target variable ('Diabetes_binary'), leading to an imbalanced dataset and potentially biased model performance.
[Encoding before Splitting (partially mitigated)]: While the code performs One-Hot Encoding *after* the train/test split, the initial filtering could still induce a subtle form of data leakage. It is better to split data *before* any kind of feature selection or filtering.
[Potential for Overfitting]: Training the model on a potentially biased and filtered dataset can lead to overfitting, where the model performs well on the training data but poorly on unseen data.
