[Class Imbalance]: The code prints the class distribution, indicating awareness of potential class imbalance in the 'Income' variable. However, it proceeds to train a Logistic Regression model without explicitly addressing this imbalance, which can lead to biased model performance, particularly in predicting the minority class.
[Lack of Feature Scaling]: The code doesn't perform any feature scaling or normalization on the input features before training the Logistic Regression model. Logistic Regression can be sensitive to the scale of input features, and not scaling them can lead to suboptimal model performance.
[No Hyperparameter Tuning]: The code uses Logistic Regression with default hyperparameters (except for max_iter). It does not include any hyperparameter tuning using cross-validation or other optimization techniques, which could potentially improve model performance.
