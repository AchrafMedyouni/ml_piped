[Lack of data exploration]: The code directly loads the data and proceeds with model training without any exploratory data analysis (EDA). This can lead to overlooking important data characteristics, potential issues like missing values, outliers, or class imbalance, and can affect the model's performance.
[No handling of class imbalance]: The target variable, 'Diabetes_binary', might have imbalanced classes. If the classes are imbalanced, the model might be biased towards the majority class, resulting in poor performance on the minority class. The code doesn't implement any techniques to address this potential class imbalance.
[Lack of feature scaling/normalization]: The code uses features with potentially different scales without any scaling or normalization. Features with larger values might dominate the model, leading to suboptimal performance.
[No hyperparameter tuning]: The code uses a RandomForestClassifier with default or arbitrarily chosen hyperparameters (n_estimators=100). There's no hyperparameter tuning performed to optimize the model's performance for the given dataset.
[Insufficient evaluation]: The model is evaluated only using accuracy and a classification report on the test set. This might not be sufficient to assess the model's performance comprehensively. Other metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC might be necessary depending on the problem. Cross-validation is not utilized.
[No model persistence]: The trained model is not saved for future use. The code trains the model every time it's executed, which is inefficient.
[No cross validation]: The model performance is only evaluated on a single test set, without any cross-validation. This can lead to overfitting to the specific train/test split and may not generalize well to unseen data.
