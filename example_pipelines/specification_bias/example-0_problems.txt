[Data leakage]: The entire dataset is used to identify categorical and numerical columns before the train/test split. This can lead to information leakage from the test set into the training set during preprocessing (specifically within SimpleImputer and OneHotEncoder), potentially resulting in over-optimistic performance estimates.  
[Lack of hyperparameter tuning]: The RandomForestClassifier is used with default hyperparameters. Without tuning, the model might not be performing optimally for the given dataset.
[Imbalanced data]: The code does not handle potential class imbalance in the target variable 'salary'. This can lead to biased model performance favoring the majority class. The classification report will reveal if the data is imbalanced, but the code does not attempt to address the issue.
[No cross-validation]: The model's performance is evaluated on a single train/test split. There's no cross-validation used, which could give a more robust estimate of the model's generalization performance.
